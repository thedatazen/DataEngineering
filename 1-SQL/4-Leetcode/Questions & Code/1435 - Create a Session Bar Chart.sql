/*Question:

Table: Sessions

+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| session_id          | int     |
| duration            | int     |
+---------------------+---------+

You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>" and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it.

Write an SQL query to report the (bin, total) in any order.

Sessions table:
+-------------+---------------+
| session_id  | duration      |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 30            |
| 2           | 199           |
| 3           | 299           |
| 4           | 580           |
| 5           | 1000          |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| bin          | total        |
+--------------+--------------+
| [0-5>        | 3            |
| [5-10>       | 1            |
| [10-15>      | 0            |
| 15 or more   | 1            |
+--------------+--------------+
